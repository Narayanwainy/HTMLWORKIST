	<p>Lacking completely in work experience although I have marked my Father multiple choice questions for his business and economic Exams, which personally I believe gives me the needed experience to teach a class of unruly children. Currently am planning on continuing my learnign onto a university, mayhaps that university will be CSU, mayhaps it will not be.
